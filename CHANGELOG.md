# Changelog

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- **WebSocket IPC channel** — a new `Channel` capability provides a bidirectional, ordered, low-latency channel backed by a local WebSocket server. Use `app.channel_send(name, data)` from Crystal and `Channel.on` / `Channel.send` from JavaScript for high-frequency or continuous data streams (tickers, log tails, LLM token output) where the event bus's per-call `evaluateJavaScript` overhead would become a bottleneck. The channel auto-reconnects on disconnect and can be excluded via `lune.yml` if not needed.

### Added

- **`file_watch` capability** — monitor files and directories for filesystem changes. Call `FileWatch.watch(path)` / `FileWatch.unwatch(path)` from JavaScript; subscribe to change events with `FileWatch.on(cb)`. Events carry `{path, kind}` where `kind` is `"modified"`, `"created"`, `"deleted"`, or `"renamed"`. Backed by kqueue (`EVFILT_VNODE`) on macOS and inotify on Linux — no polling, no extra system dependencies. Hard-depends on `event_bus`; automatically disabled with a warning if `event_bus` is excluded.
- **`opts.file_watch.debounce`** — configurable debounce window (default 50 ms) that collapses the burst of raw OS events produced by a single editor save into one logical event per path. Set to `0.milliseconds` to receive raw events.

### Fixed

- **Linux inotify buffer overread** — the inotify event loop now validates `buf.size >= sizeof(InotifyEvent)` and `step <= buf.size` before advancing the pointer; a short read or an oversized `ev.len` could previously walk past the buffer end.
- **Darwin kevent fd leak on registration failure** — `FileWatch.add_watch` now registers the kevent before storing the fd in the watch map, and closes the fd if `kevent()` returns an error. Previously a failed registration left the fd recorded but unwatched (silent no-op).
- **Tray `setMenu` crash on malformed input** — the `set_menu` bridge callback now uses safe JSON navigation and wraps the parse in a typed rescue; a missing `id`/`label` key or invalid JSON previously caused a hard `TypeCastError` crash.
- **File-drop callback crash on unexpected JSON** — the native drop callbacks on both macOS and Linux now use `?.try(&.as_i?)`/`?.try(&.as_s?)` with safe defaults; malformed JSON from the native layer previously raised `TypeCastError`.
- **Bridge TOCTOU race in `dispatch_result`** — the closed guard is now checked both before queuing the dispatch *and* inside the queued block, closing the window where the webview could be torn down between the pre-dispatch check and block execution.
- **`WindowState.load_from` bare rescue** — replaced with a typed rescue on `JSON::ParseException | TypeCastError | File::Error | IO::Error`; failures now log a warning instead of silently returning nil.
- **Channel silent message-parse failure** — the bare `rescue` in the WebSocket message handler now captures and logs the exception at debug level.
- **Clipboard command failures silently ignored** — `DEFAULT_READ` and `DEFAULT_WRITE` now check `Process.run` exit status and log a warning on failure; missing binaries (`xclip`, `pbpaste`) now rescue `File::Error | IO::Error` and log instead of crashing or returning empty silently.

- **`file_watch` double-start in dev mode** — in dev mode the runner called `install` twice on the same capability instances (once for the real app, once to collect bindings for JS codegen). `FileWatch` opened two kqueue/inotify fds and the second fiber held a reference to a stub app with no bridge, so all file events were silently dropped. `start` is now idempotent, and the dev-mode binding collection pass skips capabilities already installed for the real app.
- **`app.emit` crash when `event_bus` excluded** — calling `app.emit` with the event bus capability disabled threw `TypeError: crystalEmit is not a function` in JS. The Crystal side now guards the call, and no-op JS stubs are injected for `crystalEmit`, `on`, `off`, and `jsEmit` so frontend code that references them doesn't throw.
- **Channel JS stubs when `channel` excluded** — similarly, `chOn`, `chOff`, and `chSend` are stubbed as no-ops when the channel capability is inactive, preventing crashes in frontend code that references them unconditionally.

### Internal

- **Binding boilerplate reduced** — `Dialogs` message variants, `Clipboard` read/write registrations, and `Window` zero-arg operations (minimize/maximize/center) are now table-driven loops; the four identical `message_*` blocks, six identical clipboard blocks, and three identical window blocks each collapse to a single descriptor array. No behaviour change.
- **`Runner#webview` decomposed** — capability webview-init (sentinel injection + stub JS for excluded capabilities) extracted to `inject_capability_init`; the navigation branch (html/url/dev_url/assets) extracted to `setup_navigation`. The `webview` body drops from ~100 lines to ~60.
- **`Generator` JS/DTS grouping deduplicated** — `generate_runtime_js` and `generate_runtime_dts` shared identical 10-line namespace-grouping logic; extracted to `namespace_groups(&helper_fn)` called with `&.js_helpers` / `&.dts_helpers`.

- **Capability architecture** — each capability now declares a `Descriptor` (id, label, deps, soft_deps, core) and opts into lifecycle phases via modules (`Capability::Bindable`, `Capability::WebviewInject`, `Capability::Lifecycle`) rather than overriding no-op base methods. Context structs (`SetupCtx`, `BindCtx`, `WebviewCtx`) replace scattered argument lists. `name` derives from `descriptor.id` — no per-capability override needed. The registry runs a `setup` pass so handle- and options-dependent capabilities pull state from context instead of constructor injection. `Registry#resolve` applies include/exclude config, cascade-disables capabilities whose hard deps are inactive (with logged warnings), emits soft-dep warnings, and topologically sorts the result. The runner dispatches through `is_a?` phase checks and calls `shutdown` on `Lifecycle` capabilities after `wv.run`. `App#install(cap : Capability)` added as a convenience for installing capabilities from user code.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- **Main-thread crash** — all native AppKit (macOS) and GTK (Linux) UI calls — dialogs, window controls, tray, context menus — now dispatch synchronously to the main thread when invoked from a background fiber. Eliminates the intermittent `NSInternalInconsistencyException: nextEventMatchingMask should only be called from the Main Thread!` crash.

### Changed

- **`async: true` bindings use a shared thread pool** — async binding callbacks and `app.async` blocks now spawn fibers into a `Fiber::ExecutionContext::Parallel` pool instead of creating a new OS thread per call. Reduces overhead for apps that fire async bindings frequently.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-18

### Breaking

- **Namespaced JS API** — `runtime.js` now exports PascalCase namespace objects with camelCase methods instead of flat functions. `quit()` → `System.quit()`, `clipboardRead()` → `Clipboard.read()`, `screenInfo()` → `Screen.info()`, `on()` → `Events.on()`, etc. A `runtime` default export bundles all namespaces. All TypeScript declarations updated to match.
- **`lifecycle` capability renamed to `system`** — update `lune.yml` (`lifecycle` → `system`); JS namespace is now `System` (was `Lifecycle`); bridge IDs changed from `__lune.lifecycle.*` to `__lune.system.*`.
- **`LuneError` class** — rejected promises now reject with `LuneError extends Error` instead of a plain object. `err.code` is the machine-readable error type; `err.message` replaces the old `err.error` field. `err instanceof LuneError` and `err instanceof Error` both work. `runtime.d.ts` exports `LuneError` as a class declaration.
- **`drop.enabled` removed** — file drop is now activated solely by including `file_drop` in the `capabilities` list in `lune.yml`. `opts.drop` configures behaviour only (`zone`, `value`, `on_drop`, `disable_webview_drop`). Passing `d.enabled = true` no longer compiles.
- **`FileDrop.on` / `FileDrop.off`** — renamed from `onFileDrop` / `onFileDropOff`.
- **Context menu API changed** — `setContextMenu(items)` / `clearContextMenu()` / `onContextMenu(cb)` replaced by the namespaced `ContextMenu.set(items)` / `ContextMenu.clear()` / `ContextMenu.onSelect(cb)`.
- **`Lune::Capability` refactored to abstract class** — was a plain value object; now an abstract base class with `name`, `install(app)`, `init_webview(wv, handle, app)`, `js_helpers`, and `dts_helpers`. All concrete capability classes inherit from it.
- **`Capabilities::Registry` now instance-based** — `Registry.all(handle, ...)` class method replaced by `Registry.new(handle, options).all` / `.active(config)` / `.validate(config)`.

### Added

- **`lune dist`** — new CLI command that packages the built app for distribution. On macOS produces a DMG via `hdiutil` with an `/Applications` symlink; if `mac.notarize: true` and credentials are set, submits to Apple's notary service and staples the ticket. On Linux assembles an AppDir and runs `appimagetool` to produce a self-contained `.AppImage`. Use `--skip-notarize` to skip notarization on macOS.
- **`mac.notarize`** — new `lune.yml` option (`Bool`, default `false`). Enables automatic notarization and stapling in `lune dist`.
- **`mac.entitlements`** — new `lune.yml` option (`String?`). Path to a custom entitlements plist passed to `codesign` during `lune build`. When omitted, Lune generates a minimal default that satisfies WKWebView under hardened runtime.
- **`mac.bundle_id`** — new `lune.yml` option (`String?`). Overrides the `CFBundleIdentifier` in `Info.plist` (default: `dev.lune.<app_name>`).
- **Deep links / `url_schemes`** — registers OS-level URL handlers. `lune build` injects `CFBundleURLTypes` into `Info.plist` (macOS); `lune dist` injects `MimeType` entries into the `.desktop` file (Linux). The app receives URLs via `DeepLink.on(cb)` in JS. macOS uses `NSAppleEventManager`; Linux reads the URL from `ARGV` on startup.
- **`name` drives artifact naming** — `lune.yml`'s `name` field now controls the output artifact name (`build/bin/<name>.app`, `build/bin/<name>.dmg`). `CFBundleName` in `Info.plist` also uses `name`. Previously the name was always derived from `app_entry`.
- **Rich clipboard** — `Clipboard.readHtml()`, `Clipboard.writeHtml(html)`, `Clipboard.readImage()` (returns `data:image/png;base64,...` or `""`), and `Clipboard.writeImage(dataUrl)`. macOS backed by `NSPasteboard`; Linux backed by `xclip`.
- **Context menus** — `ContextMenu.set(items)` / `ContextMenu.clear()` / `ContextMenu.onSelect(cb)` register a native right-click menu from JS. The `contextmenu` event is intercepted automatically; the selected item `id` is delivered to the callback. Items support `id`, `label`, `enabled`, and `separator`. macOS backed by `NSMenu popUpMenuPositioningItem:atLocation:inView:`.
- **Drag-out** — `DragOut.start(paths)` initiates a native macOS drag session from JS. Call it from a `pointerdown` handler to let users drag local files from the app into Finder or another drop target. Backed by `NSView beginDraggingSessionWithItems:event:source:`.
- **Distribution guide** — new website page documenting the full signing, packaging, and notarization workflow.

### Changed

- **Bridge IDs** — internal WebView binding identifiers changed from `runtime.__lune.<camelCase>` to `__lune.<capability>.<snake_case>` (e.g. `runtime.__lune.clipboardRead` → `__lune.clipboard.read`). Affects only code calling `window[id]` directly.
- **`capabilities` refactored to `include`/`exclude` struct** — `capabilities:` in `lune.yml` is now a map with optional `include` and `exclude` keys instead of a flat array. `include` restricts to the listed capabilities; `exclude` removes from whatever `include` resolved to. Both keys accept `"*"` or `"all"` as wildcards. Omitting `capabilities:` entirely still exposes everything.
- **Capabilities operate at group granularity** — `include`/`exclude` target whole capability groups (e.g. `system`, `clipboard`). Individual function names are not valid and log a warning.
- **Dev vs build enforcement** — in dev mode the bridge is filtered but `runtime.js` always contains all helpers so hot-reload keeps working. In build mode both are filtered; importing an excluded function is a hard bundler error.
- **Startup warnings for unknown capability names** — any unknown name in `include` or `exclude` logs a warning before the window opens.
- **Dev warning for orphan config** — in debug mode, logs a warning if capability options are configured but the capability is not active.
- **Tray auto-emits events** — `opts.tray` callbacks are now optional. When the `tray` capability is active, icon clicks emit `"trayEvent"` with `"click"` and menu item clicks emit `"trayEvent"` with the item `id`. Override `t.event` for a custom event name, or set `t.on_click`/`t.on_menu_click` for full Crystal-side control.
- **`Tray.setMenu` accepts an array** — auto-serialises items to JSON; `Tray.setMenu([{ id, label }])` works without manual `JSON.stringify`.
- **`disable_context_menu` demoted** — no longer a `Lune::Capability` subclass; handled as a plain option in `Runner`. `opts.disable_context_menu` unchanged.
- **`keyboard_shortcuts` demoted** — Cmd/Ctrl+C/V/Z/etc. JS injection inlined into `Runner`. Always active; not a toggleable capability.
- **`navigation` demoted** — `on_navigate` JS injection inlined into `Runner`. `opts.on_navigate` unchanged.
- **`drag_zone` demoted** — window drag zone setup inlined into `Runner`. `opts.drag.zone` / `opts.drag.value` unchanged.
- **New core capabilities** — `EventBus`, `KeyboardShortcuts`, `ContextMenu`, `Navigation`, `DisableContextMenu`, `DragZone`, and `FileDrop` are now first-class `Lune::Capability` subclasses. Previously their JS was injected as raw strings from `Runner`. They participate in `include`/`exclude` like any other capability.
- **`runtime/scripts.cr` deleted** — JS initialisation code moved into `init_webview` on the respective capability classes.
- **`Runtime::Generator` now capability-aware** — `generate_runtime_js` and `generate_runtime_dts` collect `js_helpers`/`dts_helpers` from each capability, replacing hardcoded helper blocks.
- **`runner.cr` simplified** — install and webview-init phases are now `active.each { |cap| cap.install(@app) }` / `active.each { |cap| cap.init_webview(...) }` loops; feature-specific setup methods removed.
- **Generated `App.js` stubs use named parameters** — stubs now emit `Add(arg0, arg1)` / `Add(n, label)` instead of `Add(...args)`.
- **`opts.debug` respects build mode** — uses `{{ flag?(:lune_dev) }}` so release builds correctly report `BUILD: release`.
- **Makefile demo targets renamed** — `dev`/`app`/`run` → `demo-dev`/`demo-app`/`demo-run`. New targets: `demo-release`, `demo-dist`, `demo-deploy`.
- **Demo** — new Capabilities view shows which runtime functions are available in the current build.
- **Website docs rewritten** — `guide/runtime.md`, `guide/events.md`, `guide/deep-links.md`, `guide/how-it-works.md`, `guide/typescript.md`, `configuration.md`, and `getting-started.md` updated to the new namespaced API.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **File drop zone hover** — `lune-drop-target-active` now correctly highlights the drop zone element even when the cursor is over a child element (text, icon, etc.). Previously `getComputedStyle` matched inherited CSS custom property values on child elements, adding the active class to the wrong node. Detection now uses `el.style` (inline style only), consistent with the documented API.
- **macOS drag position updates** — zone highlights during a file drag are snappy and glitch-free. The previous implementation routed each drag-move through `wv.dispatch { wv.eval(...) }` — a double-async hop (Crystal GCD dispatch → WKWebView eval queue) that let stale position evals queue up and fire out of order. The native `LuneDropView` now calls `evaluateJavaScript:completionHandler:` directly with a coalescing gate: at most one eval is in-flight at a time; if the cursor moved while waiting, the latest position flushes immediately on completion.
- Same `el.style` fix applied to window drag zones (`--lune-draggable`), preventing false matches on children inside a drag-handle container.

---

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- `mac.sign` in `lune.yml` — code-signing identity applied via `codesign --force --deep --options runtime` after `lune build`. Enables `UNUserNotificationCenter` in production builds.
- Runtime notification routing now uses the Security framework to detect a certificate-backed Apple signature (Team Identifier present) instead of checking for a bundle identifier. Ad-hoc and unsigned builds fall back to `osascript`.

### Fixed

- Makefile `dev` / `app` / `run` / `clean` targets pointed at the old `exampleapp/` path; updated to `demo/`.

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- `opts.menu { |m| }` — user-configurable macOS menu bar. Replaces the default menu when set; falls back to the standard App + Edit + Window menus when omitted.
  - `m.app_menu` / `m.edit_menu` — role menus wired to native macOS selectors (About, Services, Quit; Undo, Redo, Copy, Paste, etc.).
  - `m.submenu(label) { |f| }` — top-level custom submenu with its own item builder.
  - `f.item(label, shortcut:, enabled:) { }` — text item with optional keyboard shortcut and per-item callback block.
  - `f.separator` — horizontal separator.
  - `f.checkbox(label, checked:, shortcut:) { |on| }` — toggle item; block receives new `Bool` state.
  - `f.radio(label, selected:, shortcut:) { }` — radio item; adjacent radio items form a group automatically.
  - `f.submenu(label) { }` — nested submenu at any depth.
- `app.update_menu` — re-applies the current menu after mutating `Options::Menu::Item` properties (`label`, `enabled`, `checked`) at runtime.
- `app.set_menu { |m| }` — replaces the entire menu bar at runtime.
- `Lune::Options::Menu::Shortcut` — pure-Crystal shortcut parser: converts strings like `"cmd+n"`, `"cmd+shift+z"`, `"cmd+f1"` into the key character and `NSEventModifierFlags` bitmask used by `NSMenuItem`.
- **Class-based menu API** — subclass `Options::Menu::Group` or `Options::Menu` for apps with complex menus or where keeping state and callbacks in a dedicated class is preferred.
  - `m.submenu(group : Options::Menu::Group)` — pass a pre-built group instance instead of a block.
  - `opts.menu(m : Options::Menu)` — assign a pre-built menu instance directly.
  - Both styles (inline block and class-based) can be mixed freely.

### Changed

- **Demo app** (`demo/`, previously `exampleapp/`) — rebuilt frontend on the Vue 3 template (`lune init -t vue`): Single File Components, grouped sidebar with icons, `useLuneEvent` composable for auto-cleanup, animated starfield background, Welcome hero with orbital animation, live environment/screen stats, and a redesigned ping/pong display with per-round index and latency. Tray icon show/hide replaced with a toggle switch.
- **Options namespace reorganisation** — all option sub-types are now nested under `Lune::Options`:
  - `Lune::MacOptions` → `Lune::Options::Mac`; appearance enum moved to `Lune::Options::Mac::Appearance`
  - `Lune::DropOptions` → `Lune::Options::Drop`
  - `Lune::DragOptions` → `Lune::Options::Drag`
  - `Lune::TrayOptions` → `Lune::Options::Tray`
  - `Lune::MenuOptions` → `Lune::Options::Menu`
  - `Lune::MenuItem` → `Lune::Options::Menu::Item`
  - `Lune::MenuGroup` → `Lune::Options::Menu::Group`
  - `Lune::MenuShortcut` → `Lune::Options::Menu::Shortcut`
  - `src/lune/options.cr` reorganised into `src/lune/options/` folder with one file per component group.

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-16

### Breaking

- **Grouped options now use nested blocks** — `opts.drop { |d| }`, `opts.drag { |d| }`, `opts.tray { |t| }`, and `opts.mac { |m| }` replace the old flat properties on `Options`. Direct setter calls (e.g. `opts.on_tray_click =`, `opts.drag_zone =`, `opts.enable_file_drop =`) no longer exist.
  - `opts.on_tray_click` → `opts.tray { |t| t.on_click = ... }`
  - `opts.on_menu_click` → `opts.tray { |t| t.on_menu_click = ... }`
  - `opts.enable_file_drop` → `opts.drop { |d| d.enabled = true }`
  - `opts.on_file_drop` → `opts.drop { |d| d.on_drop = ... }`
  - `opts.drop_zone` / `opts.drop_value` → `opts.drop { |d| d.zone = ...; d.value = ... }`
  - `opts.disable_webview_drop` → `opts.drop { |d| d.disable_webview_drop = true }`
  - `opts.drag_zone` / `opts.drag_value` → `opts.drag { |d| d.zone = ...; d.value = ... }`

### Added

- `Lune::DropOptions` class — groups file drop configuration (`enabled`, `disable_webview_drop`, `zone`, `value`, `on_drop`).
- `Lune::DragOptions` class — groups window drag-handle configuration (`zone`, `value`).
- `Lune::TrayOptions` class — groups tray callbacks (`on_click`, `on_menu_click`).
- `Options` default values are now declared at the property level — `initialize` is a single no-op, removing the large explicit initializer.

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-16

### Breaking

- **Manual `crystal build` now requires `-Dpreview_mt -Dexecution_context`** — `lune dev` and `lune build` pass both flags automatically, but any manual compilation will fail without them.
- **`async: true` binding callbacks now run in true parallel on separate OS threads** — if multiple async bindings access shared Crystal state concurrently, that state must be thread-safe (use `Mutex` or `Atomic`). Previously async bindings silently never ran, so this was not a concern in practice.
- **Crystal >= 1.20.1 required** (previously >= 1.20.0).

### Added

- `app.async(name = "lune-task") { ... }` — runs a block on a dedicated OS thread (`Fiber::ExecutionContext::Isolated`). Use this for background timers, pollers, and any long-running work instead of `spawn`, which does not work in Lune apps (the native event loop owns the main thread permanently).
- `lune doctor` now validates that Crystal >= 1.20.1 is installed and reports the installed version with a clear error if it falls short.
- `make clean` target removes build artifacts for the lune binary and the example app.

### Changed

- `async: true` binding callbacks now run on a dedicated OS thread via `Fiber::ExecutionContext::Isolated` instead of a cooperative fiber. `sleep`, `Channel`, HTTP, and all blocking IO work correctly inside async bindings.
- `Bridge#dispatch_eval` (used by `app.emit`) now silently drops calls after the bridge is closed, preventing a crash when a background task emits after the window is closed.
- Production asset server (`AssetServer`) runs its HTTP accept loop on an `Isolated` thread and handles per-connection fibers on a `Parallel` pool, so embedded assets load correctly in production builds.
- Compilation flags `-Dpreview_mt -Dexecution_context` are now required and passed automatically by `lune dev`, `lune build`, and `make test`/`make build`/`make release`. Manual `crystal build` invocations must include both flags.
- Minimum Crystal version raised to `>= 1.20.1` (required for `Fiber::ExecutionContext`).
- Example app clock migrated from `spawn` to `app.async("clock")`.

### Fixed

- Async bindings on macOS/Linux were silently broken — spawned fibers never executed because the main thread was permanently blocked in the AppKit/GTK event loop. The fix uses real OS threads.
- Production builds showed a blank webview because the embedded asset HTTP server's connection-handling fibers could not be scheduled. Fixed by running the server on a `Parallel` execution context.

---

## [0.4.5] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Bidirectional event bus — `app.on`, `app.once`, `app.off`, and `app.dispatch_event` on the Crystal side let the app listen for events emitted from JavaScript. `emit(name, data?)` in `runtime.js` / `runtime.d.ts` is the JS counterpart. Both sides share a single event-name namespace, making request/response and notification patterns straightforward.
- Example app (`demo/`) — a self-contained Vite + Crystal demo that exercises drag-and-drop, tray, clipboard, file dialogs, notifications, and the event bus, serving as both a reference and a manual smoke-test harness.

---

## [0.4.4] - 2026-05-16

### Changed

- Runner inline `wv.init` JavaScript extracted into a dedicated `Lune::Runtime::Scripts` module with private methods per concern (`keyboard_shortcuts`, `event_bus`, `drag_zone`, `file_drop`). No behaviour change — internal cleanup only.

### Fixed

- Traffic lights (close/minimize/zoom) were unresponsive when both `mac.full_size_content` and `enable_file_drop` (or `on_file_drop`) were active at the same time. With `NSWindowStyleMaskFullSizeContentView` the content view spans the titlebar, so the drop overlay's hit-test was claiming traffic-light clicks. The overlay now explicitly passes through clicks that land on any standard window button.

---

## [0.4.3] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Default macOS menu bar — App, Edit, and Window menus are set up automatically so Lune apps feel like proper macOS citizens out of the box. The app name in the menu is taken from `opts.title`. No configuration required.
- `opts.mac` — macOS-specific window options grouped under a dedicated `MacOptions` struct, keeping them clearly separate from cross-platform settings.
- `opts.mac.full_size_content` — extends the content view to fill the entire window frame including the area behind the title bar, and makes the title bar itself transparent. The traffic lights remain visible.
- `opts.mac.transparent` — clears the window and WebView backgrounds so CSS `backdrop-filter` effects can sample whatever is behind the window, enabling frosted-glass / "mirror" style UIs.
- `opts.mac.hide_title` — hides the window title text while keeping the title bar and traffic lights visible. Commonly combined with `full_size_content` for a clean custom header.
- `opts.mac.appearance` — forces a specific appearance mode (`MacAppearance::Auto` / `Dark` / `Light`) regardless of the system setting.
- `opts.mac.content_protection` — prevents the window from appearing in screenshots, screen recordings, or screen sharing.
- `opts.mac.always_on_top` — keeps the window above all other windows, including those from other apps.
- `opts.drag_zone` / `opts.drag_value` — CSS custom property-based drag zones. Set `drag_zone` to a CSS property name (e.g. `"--lune-draggable"`) and any element with that property set to `drag_value` (default `"drag"`) becomes a window drag handle. Detection walks up the DOM tree so marking a container makes all its children draggable.
- `opts.disable_context_menu` — suppresses the browser's built-in right-click context menu across the entire window.
- `opts.enable_file_drop` — registers the window as a native drop target. The WebView's own drag handling is automatically suppressed so dropped files don't navigate the page.
- `opts.disable_webview_drop` — disables WebView drag handling without setting up a drop target, preventing accidental file opens without enabling the full drop API.
- `opts.drop_zone` / `opts.drop_value` — CSS custom property-based drop zones. Elements with the named property set to `drop_value` receive the `lune-drop-target-active` class while a file is held over them. Position tracking is driven natively so the class updates work even though the WebView's own dragover events are suppressed.
- `opts.on_file_drop` — Crystal callback fired on drop. Signature changed to `(Int32, Int32, Array(String)) -> Nil` — receives the drop position in logical pixels alongside the file paths. Setting this callback automatically enables file drop.
- `onFileDrop(cb)` / `onFileDropOff()` — JS runtime helpers for subscribing to file drops from the frontend. The event payload is `{ x, y, paths }`, consistent with the Crystal callback.

---

## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Window state persistence — window position and size are saved on close and restored on the next launch. State is stored at `~/Library/Application Support/<appname>/window.json` (macOS) or `~/.config/<appname>/window.json` (Linux), where `<appname>` is derived from the window title. Zero configuration required.
- App icon support — set `icon:` in `lune.yml` to bundle an icon into the `lune build` output. macOS accepts `.icns` or `.png` (auto-converted via `sips`/`iconutil`); Linux accepts `.png`.
- Extended file dialogs — `openDir(prompt)` for folder selection, `openFiles(prompt)` for multi-file selection, `messageInfo`, `messageWarning`, `messageError` for native alert dialogs, and `messageQuestion` for yes/no confirmation (returns `"Yes"` or `"No"`).

### Changed

- `generate_runtime_js` and `generate_runtime_dts` are now derived dynamically from `RuntimeBinding` instances instead of hardcoded heredoc strings. Each built-in binding carries its own arg names and optional `ts_return_type`, so the generated `runtime.js` and `runtime.d.ts` are always in sync with the registered bindings.
- Added `Lune::RuntimeBinding < Binding` subclass for runtime/internal bindings — overrides `to_js_stub` and `to_dts_sig` to emit `export function` / `export declare function` style output, and strips the `__lune.` prefix for JS function names.
- Added `App#register` to accept a pre-built `Binding` directly, bypassing `app.bind`.
- `TraySetMenuBinding < RuntimeBinding` handles the `JSON.stringify` call and `{ id, label }[]` TypeScript arg type for `traySetMenu`.
- The `@[Lune::Bind]` macro now extracts real Crystal parameter names and passes them into the generated `.d.ts` signatures. `greet(msg: string)` instead of `greet(arg0: string)`.

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- All built-in capabilities (lifecycle, filesystem, clipboard, window controls, dialogs, tray, notifications, screen) are now implemented as `Lune::Installable` classes — the same interface used by user modules. `Bindings::Native.build` and `Bindings::Runtime.build` factory methods are gone.
- `app.bind` parameter renamed: `name:` → `method:` for consistency with `Lune::Binding`
- `Lune::BindingDef` renamed to `Lune::Binding`

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Native platform features are now built into Lune — window controls, file dialogs, system tray, notifications, and screen info ship out of the box with no extra shard required
- macOS native bindings via ObjC (`NSWindow`, `NSOpenPanel`, `NSSavePanel`, `UNUserNotificationCenter`, `NSStatusBar`, `NSScreen`)
- Linux native bindings via GTK3/libnotify (`GtkWindow`, `GtkFileChooserDialog`, `GtkStatusIcon`, `libnotify`, `GdkMonitor`)
- `minimize()`, `maximize()`, `center()`, `setTitle(title)`, `setSize(width, height)` — native window controls from JS
- `openFile(prompt)`, `saveFile(prompt, defaultName)` — native file picker and save dialogs
- `trayShow(iconPath)`, `trayHide()`, `traySetIcon(path)`, `traySetMenu(items)` — system tray icon and context menu
- `notify(title, body)` — native OS notifications; macOS falls back to `osascript` for unbundled binaries
- `screenInfo()` — returns primary display width, height, and pixel scale factor
- `opts.on_tray_click` and `opts.on_menu_click` added to `Lune::Options` for wiring tray events from Crystal
- All native bindings auto-registered by `Runner` — no manual `on_window_ready` wiring required
- Native JS functions exported from `runtime.js`
- 45 new specs for native bindings, all passing via `lune_native_test_mock` compile flag
- `@app` injected into `Lune::Bindable` at install time — call `@app.emit` directly from any bound method without constructor arguments

## [0.3.6] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- Capability names corrected throughout — `readText`/`writeText` renamed to `clipboardRead`/`clipboardWrite` in ROADMAP, changelog, and specs
- Config spec and runtime bindings spec updated to use correct capability names
- Added spec for invalid capability names — unknown names are silently ignored, only real binding names are exposed

## [0.3.5] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Clipboard bridge — `clipboardRead()` and `clipboardWrite(text)` available in JS via `runtime.js`; backed by `pbpaste`/`pbcopy` on macOS, `xclip` on Linux, PowerShell/`clip.exe` on Windows
- Capability allowlist — declare `capabilities:` in `lune.yml` to restrict which runtime bindings are exposed to JS; omit the key to allow all (default)
- Website version badge — nav bar now shows the current version linking to GitHub releases; `make patch`/`make minor` keep it in sync

### Fixed

- `bind_deferred` (`src/lune/webview.cr`) now wraps `LibWebView.bind` in `check_error` — a duplicate or failed binding name raises `Webview::Error` immediately rather than silently installing nothing and leaving the JS promise permanently pending
- `@@deferred_boxes << boxed` moved to after `check_error` — on a failed bind the GC-protection box is never stored, so it is collected instead of accumulating as an unreachable entry
- `on_load` and `on_navigate` user callbacks in `runner.cr` are now wrapped in `begin/rescue` before being passed into the webview's C bind callback — an exception from user code can no longer cross the C FFI boundary (undefined behaviour); failures are logged at `error` level with a `debug`-level stacktrace, matching the pattern in `bridge.cr`

## [0.3.4] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- `lune.yml` window defaults — declare `title`, `width`, `height`, `min_width`, `min_height`, `max_width`, `max_height`, `resizable`, `debug` under a `window:` key; values apply before the `Lune.run` opts block, which can still override any of them
- App paths bridge — `homeDir()`, `tempDir()`, `downloadsDir()`, `appDataDir()` available in JS via `runtime.js`; platform-aware (`appDataDir` returns `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS, `$XDG_DATA_HOME` on Linux, `%APPDATA%` on Windows)
- VitePress documentation site under `website/`; deployed to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`

### Changed

- `Lune::Config` now refers to project config loaded from `lune.yml`; logger config class renamed to `Lune::LogConfig`
- Runtime bindings consolidated — path functions merged into `Lune::Bindings::Runtime`; no separate path module

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Dev error overlay — when `lune dev` compilation fails, a dedicated error window opens showing the Crystal compiler output. The window is owned by the CLI, stays open while you edit, and closes automatically when the next build succeeds.
- `lune init --force` (`-f`) — deletes the target directory and reinitializes from scratch.
- `lune init --skip-existing` (`-k`) — forwards `--skip-existing` to `crystal init` so the command succeeds when run inside an existing Crystal project, skipping any files that are already present.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-13

### Breaking changes

- `Lune.run` signature changed — `app` is now the first positional argument and the block yields `Lune::Options` for window configuration instead of `Lune::App` for binding setup. Bindings must be registered on `app` before calling `Lune.run`.
- `App#bind`, `App#bind_async`, `App#bind_typed`, and `App#namespace` removed. Use `Lune::Bindable` (annotation-driven) or `App#bind(name:, namespace:, args:, return_type:, async:)` directly.
- JS namespace is now the Crystal class name, not a manually declared string. Method names are camelcased: `greet` → `Greet`, `slow_echo` → `SlowEcho`.

### Added

- `Lune::Runner` — extracted webview lifecycle; enables programmatic navigation via `runner.start(html:)` or `runner.start(url:)`
- `Lune::Options` — window options as a first-class object (`title`, `width`, `height`, `min_*`, `max_*`, `resizable`, `debug`, `on_navigate`, `on_close`)
- `Lune::BindingDef` — typed binding descriptor carrying namespace, argument types, and return type
- `-Dbuild_mode` compile flag — Crystal app runs in a pre-pass to generate `App.js` / `App.d.ts` before frontend bundling, so typed exports are available in production builds
- `App.d.ts` now contains precise TypeScript signatures derived from Crystal method annotations, not just `Promise<unknown>` stubs

### Changed

- `Lune::Bindable` uses the Crystal class name as the JS namespace; nested namespaces follow `::` (`Math::Trig` → `api.Math.Trig`)
- `Lune::Runtime` generates structured namespaced JS and typed `.d.ts` from `BindingDef` arrays
- `Lune::Bindings::Runtime` returns `Array(BindingDef)` instead of registering directly on the bridge
- CLI commands reorganized under `LuneCLI::Commands` module; constants extracted to `constants.cr`
- `generate_bindings` moved inside `Build#run` so test doubles fully cover the build path

### Specs

- Reorganized under `spec/lune/` and `spec/lune_cli/` mirroring source layout
- 128 examples covering `App`, `Bridge`, `Runtime`, `RuntimeBindings`, `Runner`, and all CLI commands

## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- `lune dev` now passes the configured `frontend.dir` to the compiled app via `LUNE_FRONTEND_DIR`, so `write_js` writes to the correct directory (e.g. `ui/lunejs/`) instead of the hardcoded `frontend/lunejs/`

### CI

- Release workflow — pushing a `v*` tag builds `lune-linux-x86_64`, `lune-darwin-arm64`, and `lune-darwin-x86_64` and attaches them to the GitHub release

### Internal

- Reorganize CLI internals

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- **Windows**: run the webview on a dedicated OS thread via `Fiber::ExecutionContext::Isolated` so Crystal's IO scheduler is not starved by the WebView2 C event loop (based on Crystal core team guidance)
- **Windows**: replace `LibC.flock` with cross-platform `flock_exclusive` — `flock(2)` is POSIX-only; the stdlib wrapper uses `LockFileEx` on Windows

### CI

- Windows runner downloads WebView2 SDK headers via NuGet before `shards install`
- Windows runs `--no-codegen` type-check; webview `.lib` linking is not supported in CI

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- CLI is now fully config-driven via `lune.yml` — removed `--frontend-dir`, `--app-entry`, `--dev-cmd`, `--build-cmd`, and `--dev-url` flags from all commands
- Logger no longer duplicates Argy error output; timestamped logs only appear during runtime events (compilation, file watching, etc.)
- Doctor command hardened for config-driven operation

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- `lune.yml` project config for frontend toolchain — `app_entry`, `frontend.dir`, `frontend.install`, `frontend.build`, `frontend.dev.cmd`, `frontend.dev.url`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-XX

### Added

- Runtime JS API and TypeScript definitions generated from registered bindings
- Event bus — `app.emit()` pushes events from Crystal to the frontend
- `lune doctor` command — checks Crystal, Node, npm, shards, and frontend deps
- Single-instance lock for `lune dev` and `lune run`
- Command aliases (`d` for dev, `b` for build, `r` for run)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-XX

### Added

- Keyboard shortcuts injected via `wv.init` (copy/paste/undo/redo/select-all)

### Fixed

- Binding errors only show stack traces under `--debug`

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-XX

### Fixed

- Pass `binding_names` to `Runtime.write_js` in dev mode

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-XX

### Fixed

- Windows compatibility fixes

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-XX

Initial release.
